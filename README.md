#  Customer Churn Prediction

# Project Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to leave and help businesses improve retention strategies.

---

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation with metrics (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score)
- Deployment-ready pipeline
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance  
- Final model selection and interpretation

---

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Conda for environment management
